  A modern web application for fetching and displaying weather information. This app allows users to search for current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for cities around the world. It also maintains a history of recent searches.

  ## Description
  The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for weather data in any city. It provides the current weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, and humidity, as well as a 5-day forecast. The application is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The front-end interface allows users to enter a city name and view its weather data, while the back-end retrieves the data from the OpenWeather API and stores search history. The app is deployed on Render and provides a seamless experience for users to plan their trips or daily activities based on weather conditions.
